### **Synopsis**

**Name / Title of the Project:**
Social Connect: A Location-Based Social Interaction App with ML Features

**Statement about the Problem:**
To reduce loneliness by enabling people to connect with nearby users based on activities, moods, and interests. Current social media platforms are often geared towards maintaining existing global connections and lack features that support spontaneous, real-time, local companionship.

**Objective and Scope of the Project:**

- **Objective:** To enable real-time connections based on shared activities and moods, provide ML-powered friend recommendations, detect emotions from text, and rank stories for personalized engagement.
- **Scope:** The initial phase will focus on a map-based interface showing users within a 1 km radius. The platform will support activity notes, interactive story sharing, and secure chat. All interactions will be privacy-focused, and recommendations will be driven by user activities, stories, and moods.

**Process Description (Methodology):**
The project's core ML pipeline will be developed using the following five-stage process:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Gathering raw data from user interactions, including selected activities, custom text notes, posted stories (text/media), expressed moods, and connection patterns (who requests/accepts whom).
2.  **Preprocessing:** Cleaning the acquired text data (removing stop words, punctuation), feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF for text), and labeling data for mood detection.
3.  **Model Training & Selection:**
    - **Recommendation:** A hybrid model using Collaborative Filtering (users with similar connection patterns) and Content-Based Filtering (users with similar interests/activities).
    - **Emotion Detection:** An NLP model using Sentiment Analysis techniques (e.g., LSTM or a pre-trained transformer like BERT) to classify text into mood categories.
    - **Story Ranking:** An engagement prediction model (e.g., Gradient Boosting) trained on features like story topic, user similarity, and time of day to predict relevance.
4.  **Recommendation & Ranking:** Deploying the trained models to suggest friends with similar hobbies and moods in real-time and to rank the story feed based on predicted user interest.
5.  **User Interface:** Integrating the model outputs into a seamless UI, including the real-time map view, story posting interface, and a secure chat request system.

**Hardware & Software to be used:**

- **Hardware:** Development PC (8GB RAM, i5/i7).
- **Software:** Python (NLP, ML libs), React.js, Node.js, MongoDB.
- **Tools:** Jupyter, GitHub, Geolocation APIs, Sentiment Analysis APIs.

**Future Work of this Project:**
Future enhancements include expanding the connection radius and offering global friend suggestions, integrating audio/voice emotion analysis for richer communication, implementing AI-based anomaly detection for enhanced safety (spam/fake accounts), and developing a dedicated mobile app with push notifications.

**The Schedule of the project:**
